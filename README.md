# Neddit

Neddit is an online forum, in the style of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) where users can create and read articles. This repository contains the front-end to the app which has been built in React.

[Click to see Neddit](https://neddit.netlify.com/)

 - If you haven't used the application before, please allow a bit longer for the server to wake up.

 - Please login with 'jessjelly' to see majority of the options.

I've built it using a back-end API that I made a couple weeks prior. The API is built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a database.
